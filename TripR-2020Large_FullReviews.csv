d680501,g186338,London,"Oxo Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie",Restaurant,"Have long wanted to visit this restaurant but came away somewhat disappointed. The positives are location and in general the service,with one exception. Directly overlooking the Thames this would be a magical location in Summer or at night as the city lights took over. Very good location for the National Theatre as it is only 400 meters walk along the river. Less positive about the food. The chestnut soup was really good as was the langoustine starter. The pork rib eye was a big piece of meat that was fairly tough, it would have been dramatically better if it was slow cooked. As it was served with some mashed potato and fennel pickle this reminded me of meals in Bavaria in the 1980's. Not good. Overall the meal and drinks were expensive and did not really deliver good value for the price paid.Negative. I watched waiter who was setting up a table blow something from the side plate to get rid of it. Not really what you want to see. This certainly clouded my overall experience.",Date of visit: January 2018,3,3,4,3,OXO Tower Restaurant,UID_2069FDC1AB8797BF77F40C541B350543,"Munich, Germany",grwpl

We has been to Skylon for drinks just before and wished we had stayed for dinner!!!I don't mind spending the money when I think it is worth it. Unfortunately last night was not and it has put me off the place. Brief rundown...Langoustines... £16...5 small pieces (size of 5 prawns!)...Lobster Tempura...£20...in fairness this was amazing with a lot of lobster.Scallops...£22.5...3 scallops, cooked well...but 3!Pot roast cod...£24.5...cod was perfect. However, the onion compote was more like SAUERKRAUT...and was vile and spoiled the dish. They took this off the bill...our waitress said that it was not ordered very much!Monkfish...£27.5...nothing to write home about.Venison...£29.5...this was very good and decent portionFries were not on the menu but we asked for some and they did oblige and they were very good...brownie points for this.Unfortunately in no way did the good make up for the bad!Finally, the view is amazing but you pay for it.

This is a restaurant with a buzz - open plan kitchen, lots of action, tables which are close together, high ceilings and not one thing in the place to deaden the noise and chatter. Despite all this we loved it. It makes a change sometimes to go somewhere where there is such an atmosphere and not eat in a restaurant where you feel you cannot talk above a whisper. The choice on the menu and the meals served were very good whilst the service was excellent - attentive, friendly and not rushed. The biggest plus however for this restaurant is the view of the Thames - fantastic (which probably reflects in the slightly high cost of the meal) but worth noting that not all the tables have a great view.

The view is of course very good, although you can go to the bar and get the same view for the price of a drink.The brasserie is however pretty terrible. The table was very cramped, not nearly big enough for six. The food was very poor - both the squid starter and scallop main were overcooked and flavourless, and to quote the Woody Allen joke - such small portions. Other dishes were described as middling to poor. For some reason, a poor guitarist decided to start playing literally six inches from the back of one of our party's heads.

d680501,g186338,London,"Oxo Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie",Restaurant,"Have visited the OXO a few times in the past, and it has always been consistently very good (but not perfect). Our dinner was on a Tuesday and the restaurant was at half occupancy, and quiet with no music, so lacking in atmosphere a little- we were also not seated by the window, but right in the middle. Starters were very good, particularly the langoustines. My main was perfectly cooked (steak) but the ravioli pasta was very hard; so probably not fresh, and the fish main was bland and lacking in flavour. No salt or pepper on the table. Service was variable, and it would have been nice to have had one waiter (As opposed to three, who didn't seem to be communicating with each other).

d680501,g186338,London,"Oxo Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie",Restaurant,"One of the good things about this restaurant, besides the food, is the great views it has of the Thames skyline. We had booked for a late lunch (2 pm) and although all the tables besides the windows had been taken you still get a great view. There is an outside terrace so even if you get a window table the views of the Thames itself are limited but not the skyline. We were offered a table next to the window tables but they are very close together so we opted for one further back. The restaurant is large, modern and very spacious. We had chosen the 3 course set luncheon menu which included a glass of champagne. The menu offered 3 options for each course. My wife started with the tomato and mozzarella salad whilst I chose the sardines. This dish consisted of 4 sides of sardines on a crispbread with a dressing. We both enjoyed our starters. For main courses my wife chose the chicken with jersey royal potatoes which was more like a whole small poussin. I chose the salmon which was served slightly pink with pea mash & asparagus. Again no complaints and the portion sizes where generous. For dessert my wife chose the lemon posset whilst I had the chocolate and gingerbread - if you like chocolate desserts this is definitely the dessert for you. There is an extensive wine list which includes a number of wines from Harvey Nichols who own the restaurant. The wine list covers wines from a number of less well known wine producing countries with prices from £30 upwards. The only criticism was that the service was so rushed and if we hadn't delayed over our coffee and dessert we would have been in & out within an hour which is not really what we wanted. It wasn't as if the restaurant was stopping service as more people arrived for lunch after 3 pm !!!!. The service itself was efficient though we did have to ask for spoons with our coffee but not that friendly.

Things took a slight turn for the worse as it took ages to get to our table, I would say a good hour. Anyway, worth waiting, as we got a great table near the window. Much have been inspired by the view as I went for fish and fish. Started with the squid, which was slightly overcooked and not quite crispy. May seem odd but this is how it turned up. Well seasoned and fresh aioli though and plenty of fish added together to make a decent dish. For the main I had the scallops, which again were plentiful, with fantastic flavours and perfectly cooked. Had a really decent bottle of Chablis to wash it down with. Didn't get round to dessert, which I think was a combination of the time, knocking on for 4 by the time we had finished, and the size of the portions.

Once you arrive at the eighth floor you are given your first taste of the excellent service provided. It wasn't a sufficiently warm day enjoy dining on the terrace although some people braved it because the views of London and the riverside are fabulous. We dined in the brasserie. If you seriously enjoy a gin and tonic make sure to order the tonic separately otherwise your drink will be already mixed when served. Parmesan pannacotta was sublime and the presentation was like a work of art. At our table the gazpacho was enjoyed and so too was the brasaola. Roasted cod was beautifully cooked and I would return if only to enjoy this once again! All the food was delightful and the service very good. My only slight irritation is the policy that you can only have your table for two hours. I know this is a popular restaurant but when meeting friends for lunch a two hour slot isn't enough. We moved to have drinks at the lounge area but were told that it was reserved for a private function. To their credit the staff escorted us into the bar area of the restaurant where we enjoyed some very good cocktails!

d731402,g186338,London,The Wolseley,Restaurant,"We came here with friends to celebrate my 60th birthday that very day, I have had The Wolseley on my list of London restaurants for some time and this seemed a fitting occasion. Unfortunately things went wrong from the very start...It was a busy Saturday evening and as we arrived 20 minutes early were ushered into the adjoining bar to wait for it to be “ready shortly”. After half an hour I went through to ask if it would be much longer to be told “it’s there and ready” - they just forgot to let us know. Not a big deal, we sat down and perused the menus for a while but I noticed my wife getting agitated and was otherwise engaged. I subsequently discovered that she’d spoken to the restaurant on a couple of occasions to ensure that there would be a cold bottle of champagne waiting on the table when we sat down, this was also forgotten. It arrived a few minutes later but the surprise had gone because I overheard her complaining to somebody behind us. Oh well...We ordered our starters and main courses and three of us decided to share half a dozen oysters to kick off and we took the advice of the chap taking our order from the three available. They were poor, three of them were non-existent - I’m not sure how or why the shucker placed them on the tray. We tried to scrape something from the shells but there was little or nothing there you’d put in your mouth so we requested some more. Two more came (not sure why only two) and they were a little better but my wife was getting a little irritated now and asked for another half dozen and some prawns (as we would have undoubtedly added to the order post oysters). These came and there was some improvement from the initial order...Mains consisted of two chicken Kiev’s, a coq au vin and brill plus various sides. We were initially told that the Kiev’s were not available but then they found two - how we wished they hadn’t. I can honestly say that I’ve had better chicken Kiev’s from Marks & Spencer, lacking in garlic butter, they weren’t supremes of chicken and were unremarkable and bland to say the least. During the meal, our (very pleasant) waiter knocked a glass of our Albariño over my wife - utterly the wrong person (if ever there’s a right one) as it was just as she’d decided her coq au vin was poor. I can endorse her opinion because I tried it. It looked the part but again lacked any real depth of flavour, I could and do prepare a far superior version and I’m not a chef. She ate less than a quarter...We decided we’d had enough and didn’t want dessert, my wife complained while I was in the Gents and a lady who seemed to be floor manager or front of house kindly knocked off the cost of the starters, the spilled wine and my wife’s main course but to be honest our evening had been ruined and money wasn’t the issue. I tried to play it down but our we had also paid the best part of £100 just to get to the restaurant and we returned straight home to Hertfordshire afterwards feeling rather flat...I don’t know if this was a one-off but everything seemed to go awry on such an important evening in such a well known restaurant. At my age I’m aware that these things can happen but my wife is less forgiving because she organised it all, it was all such a shame.",Date of visit: July 2017,-1,2,-1,-1,A Sorry Tale,UID_AA15B125C711FCE78F70DAEE64DF3B5E,"Stevenage, United Kingdom",Nidgehammer

d731402,g186338,London,The Wolseley,Restaurant,"Went for Dinner on 18 October 2012 in a party of 31) PLACE: ok here is the biggest strength it’s a buzzing lounge in the best location in London – Cant really go far wrong on ambiance it’s a no brainer so much so that the Wolseley confidently charges a £2 Cover Charge per diner! The grand, 1920s building was once a Wolseley car showroom its not simply the lunch or dinner menu btw, but everything else so you could come here for a full English breakfast and Kedgeree, quick sandwich at the bar, full afternoon tea. Its all good!2) SERVICE: very smart, sharp waiters scooting around and a few very chatty and smiley managers supervising which is always a good thing. The servers could be a bit more welcoming but they are also very busy so I guess its tough.3) FOOD: Now here comes the science bit, to do this place justice one has to break it down into ""Quality v Taste"". The Wolseley has clearly and unapologetically made clear that it is about reliable comfort food and nothing to do with gourmet excellence. If you are expecting Gordon Ramsay then you are in for a disappointment as you need to know one thing before you step in, this is about very very very very simple cooking of good quality ingredients. Starters were grilled tiger prawns with butter and I tell you it was literally that, Atlantic Prawns were served cold (very fresh) with Mayo. Moving onto mains we had the Duck confit, excellent quality duck cooked to tender perfection. Ribeye steak literally grilled and plated, I needed to add salt and pepper for flavor and finally the halibut which was not marinated so I asked to béarnaise to move it along. You see the picture, the restaurant is saying that our ingredients are so good we don’t need to dress them up. The trouble is that if you are in the mood for some flavor (which I was!) then you are going to find it a bit bland. Quality on the other had could not be flawed - enough said. 4) Desserts we had fig pudding, treacle tart and apple crumble all were spot on, save some room for the desserts as they are a lot of them and they are special! 5) PRICE: Very good value, use the website link to see the full menu with prices and remember the £2 cover charge per diner. Overall, a good sharp brasserie for a quality hearty meal with friends or business, and it gets four stars on that basis.Not a place for romantics or gastronomy hunters.

d731402,g186338,London,The Wolseley,Restaurant,"Arrived for dinner with a girlfriend and a friend (without reservation). Was very close to being turned away- in short, we were told there were no available tables until our friend mentioned knowing one of the managers- all of a sudden there was a table for us (the room was half empty anyway). On that basis, and despite having had two fantastic lunches in the past here, the evening was tinted by the feeling that they didn't really want us to be there. Cannot fault the food, but perhaps slightly less abrupt staff would do the place some favours. The dining room is very very ""open"" so perhaps not the best venue for an intimate date, as most diners seem entirely too concerned with everyone else's business (last lunch there was approached by a stranger who gave me a ""compliment""- whilst sat opposite my date, this time, me and my friend were being very intensely stared at by a couple of other diners, the first time going was much the same). Uncomfortable. The restaurant seems to be mainly populated with slightly huffy clientèle. Atmosphere and service are integral to the experience, and I think if you are under 30, or looking for a date venue, this is not an appropriate restaurant.

It is a year since we were last there but the restaurant doesn't change at all. Why would it? When you have a successful product why mess with it. The welcome was very good. We were shown to a table for 2 which was quite small for having lunch and was also very close to the next table. At times it felt more like a table for 4 rather than 2 tables for 2. I started my meal with a very tasty beetroot and goat's cheese salad. May partner chose a fish soup. For my main course I chose to go for the roast beef and Yorkshire pudding. The roast potatoes and vegetable were very tasty. The Yorkshire pudding was very dry. It had clearly been standing out too long since it was cooked. The beef was tasty but had a lot of very tough gristle that it was difficult to cut through. My partner had a smoked haddock dish served with mashed potato that I am informed was very good. We accompanied the meal with a bottle of Gigondas that was sensibly priced. Throughout the meal we had excellent service, as we usually experience when we visit the Wolseley.

Don't be confused though with 'fine dining'; the Wolseley is essentially a cafe - all be it the most upmarket cafe you've ever been in! You can eat here anytime from breakfast until the small hours. There's an 'always available' cafe menu and various lunch and other special menus.The room is stunning - full of history and very grand. The atmospsphere is very buzzy.

Get the cheapest wine (it's more than adequate) and sit back and people watch - it has been full or almost full every time we have been.Booking is worthwhile (you can do it online) but you stand a good chance of being seated without a booking if you aren't fussy about where you sit.

Up to now, it had been a reliable and enjoyable touch of class. Sad to report that something has gone terribly wrong recently.We arrived without a booking hoping for a relaxed brunch ahead of a day shopping. The first thing of note was that there was no doorman (always used to be). Without a booking, I expected a short wait and we were shown into the bar area. We ordered coffees. Despite standing right next to a coffee machine, these drinks had to be brought from elsewhere. We waited. The coffees didn't arrive but we were shown into the small room just off the entrance (which was fine - we had no reservation after all).The table was a little shabby as was the service station it was next to. I commented last time that it needed a lick of paint - it still does! The coffees finally arrived.We ordered brunch and two bucks fizz. The food arrived reasonably promptly but wasn't perfect. Both dishes involved bread and both were overcooked in this department - although my wife's eggs were very good. The drinks didn't arrive.Staff seemed flustered and their conversations and arguments were easily overheard. We felt uncomfortable. We got the bill only to see the two bucks fizz had been charged but not delivered. We asked for them to be taken of the bill. This caused some consternation and had to be referred to a more senior member of staff. Then the drinks were ready. We said we'd pass - it was too late now. We were leaving - or trying to.We waited and waited but no revised bill arrived. I asked again for the bill. This time it arrived minus the drinks charge. Throughout this, we overheard the senior member of staff chastising the waiter for his mistake. The waiter answered back - all overheard clearly.My wife popped to the washroom and returned with another sorry tale. The ladies washrooms had been filthy with papers all over the floor and with a fellow customer declaring one cubicle 'unusable' for reasons best not disclosed.So disappointing.

d731402,g186338,London,The Wolseley,Restaurant,"One of my favourite restaurants in London. An all round enjoyable experience. The restaurant was originally built as a very grand car showroom for Wolseley cars. Towering pillars arches and staircases up to platforms and down to the restrooms. The platforms are used as special places for a large dining group or two tables for 6 people (dependent on your size!) the car company sadly went out of business and the showroom was taken over by Barclays bank who built two managers offices at the entrance. The one on the left is now a small dining room dedicated to walk in diners and if you are very lucky and hit the time right, you can get a table in this space as it is not bookable. the office on the right is the bar with a few tables overlooking Piccadilly. The menu does not change much so it is a case of you know what you are going to get. Lovely food see the website www.thewolseley.com for breakfast lucy tea and dinner. No matter what time of day you go it is fabulous. If you are visiting from abroad it is vital to book a table so that you are not disappointed. Similarly for a special occasion, book early ask for a table ""on the shelf"" or in the centre of the restaurant, at other times see and be seen. There are celebs who can be seen often dining here as it has a very relaxed atmosphere with a smart formal restaurant. there is something for everybody on the menu even a special vegetarian menu. The restaurant is on the corner of Arlington Street next to the Ritz, nearest tube Green Park on the Victoria Line, walk down from Piccadilly or walk the length of Bond Street from Oxford Street.ENJOY!",Date of visit: April 2012,5,5,5,5,"A good meal, A special Occasion, Visiting London Book a Table well in advance",UID_CA75102C7ED78C3D6D16695ACED56130,"London, United Kingdom",HotelBloke

d731402,g186338,London,The Wolseley,Restaurant,"Popped in here for breakfast on a whim over Christmas period. Was absolutely buzzing at 11am. Almost didn't get a table (no booking). I was very hungry and thirsty as I had just done a few laps of Hyde Park. First disappointment was the fact that it took an way too long for the cappuccinos to arrive. They eventually turned up, when I prompted the waiter, after our food arrived. I went for the full English, which was perfectly acceptable, aside from the overly charred bacon (lots of it though) and the minute portion of black pudding (the highlight taste wise). My wife's French Toast though was totally decimated. I was slightly embarassed looking at this as I had been banging on about what an institution The W was. £48 for burnt food and 2 coffees is in no way acceptable.

Please tell the chef that there should not be any gravy with a Schnitzel. The chef at the Delaunay seems to know this but the chef at the Wolseley doesn't.

I don't think the chef know where Hungary is in Europe, and I bet he doesn't know its capital. Very disappointing. No flavour and the spatzle that accompanied the dish tasted like crisps!

We booked for 5.45pm, when afternoon teas were just finishing and early dinners just starting. The first thing that struck me on entering, apart from the decor of this old 'banking hall', was the bustle and indeed, if you want a quiet dinner, it doesn't quite fit the bill! Unfortunately we had a table near a waiter station, which was not ideal but changing was not really an option given how busy it was. The better tables to me, seemed to be those in the centre or on the mezzanine (very limited). Our waitress was friendly enough and reasonably efficient, although she needed a little prompting to pour the wine (too far away from the table to retrieve ourselves!). The food was very good. I had an excellent veal Holstein, which I have not had for years and my partner had the fish of day, on this occasion Hake. We passed on starters but our neighbours had pretty good looking salads. Desert offerings are pretty limited and very much 'grand cafe' style. I had a very good Millefeuille and partner a cheesecake.

Your eyes were out on stalks just waiting to see which actor or well known face would walk in next. Then there was a bit of a decline. Lunches were too busy with Essex girls drinking too much and the well known faces disappeared. I'm pleased to say that the management made the right call and refurbished the restaurant ready for a reinvention. I can now report that this has been 100% successful and this icon of the west end is back on top!Hospitality is the watchword here and you feel looked after as soon as you step in. Staff are charming (yes - that is the correct word here) and efficient. The room is now all in one so there is no longer the dread of being seated in the bar with no view. The new central bar area is a great talking point and adds to the atmosphere. the decor is pure 'Ivy' and just as you would wish. In the evening the lighting is perfect and makes it a special place.The food has never worried the inspectors from the Michelin guide but it is back to it's glory days where bistro classics are executed with aplomb. We shared a starter and then had scallops and sea bass mains. All were excellent and my wife declared the sea bass the best meal she'd had in London during our trip. For desert, we shared the baked Alaska - and I strongly recommend you do too! Flamed at your table,it was pure theatre and so well done. In the end, it wasn't a cheap meal but it was by no means any more expensive than many other lesser establishments close by.

The food is familiar (menu doesn't change much) and marvellously tasty. Not Michelin star maybe but not far off. Simple food, well prepared and served with style and just enough schmooze.After a few days of restaurant food, my wife ordered starters for both courses (portions are quite good here). Good tip - keeps cost and calories down. My bream main course was one of the best things I ate in London and the whole experience really enhanced our night at the theatre.

Constant phone calls to be made and if you hadn't been before ,and weren't on their database, it could be a frustrating process. The first time we went ,I was bowled over. The food was fairly simple but absolutely delicious and the atmosphere was terrific - a real occasion. You were almost guaranteed to see some sort of minor celebrity almost anytime. The staff were the stars though. The matre d' (name escapes me) and other staff were real charmers. No matter how much you were disappointed in the table allocated (and we dined in what was politely called 'social Siberia' several times!), they could always make it feel better.We revisited earlier this month one Saturday lunchtime. No problem getting a table - booked on the internet a couple of weeks beforehand. Arrived and were seated in the prime location - unbelievable. Then commenced a pretty ordinary two courses served by staff who were ok but just ok. No charm, no schmooze! Food was perfectly edible but not memorable. My wife pronounced her fish pie 'bland' and my pork belly wasn't in the same league as the best I've had. Wine was goosd though and reasonable.No celebrities - not even small ones. Lots of ladies from Essex and people taking photographs of themselves at the Ivy.I still enjoyed it and if I hadn't been before, I might be giving it a different rating but when the bill came, our two courses and drinks were almost as much as the set lunch at Murano or Maze or several other far superior establishments.If you're in the area, give it a try for old times sake.

My wife and I ordered a drink to start with which come ready poured -- a minor criticism. For our starters I chose the dressed crab which my wife had the tiger prawns. Both were excellent. For our main courses my wife had the duck whilst I had the T bone Veal Cutlet. Again both were excellent. We found the service throughout to be first class.

d776287,g186338,London,The Ivy,Restaurant,"We went to the Ivy for dinner on the last night before our friends flew back to the USA. We had made a reservation for 7:15 pm and the restaurant was very busy with a mixture of earlier dinners and people about to leave to go on to the theatre. We started with some predinner drinks which unfortunately took some time for our server to get right and when they came the mixers had already been poured into the glasses which I really don't like. OK I do appreciate that is a small complaint. We all started with different choices, I had the dressed crab which was excellent whilst my wife had the popcorn rock shrimps , lightly battered prawns with a spicy mayo dipping sauce which she also thought was excellent whilst our friends chose the wild mushroom soup and the octopus respectively. The soup was very good but our friend thought the octopus was far too tough. For our main courses 2 of the party had the spaghettini with prawns and chilli which they both thought was superb, I chose the Iberico pork chop served with chorizo and a couple of fried chorizo balls again excellent whilst our host chose the sirloin steak medium rare. This was served rare and was so chewy and tough he sent it back. How the Ivy could get a steak so wrong is very disappointing. The staff though were excellent and took the plate away immediately without any discussion and as the comments about the spaghettini has been so favourable he ordered a plate of that instead. This was served promptly and he also thought the dish was excellent. We decided to have desserts with our hosts sharing the vanilla crème brulee again delightful whilst we shared the burnt banana also lovely. The wine list is extensive and we had a bottle of the Alberino and a bottle of Rioja having just come back from Spain which were both excellent.

Clever that they keep the restaurant special as it is almost impossible to get a table unless you book weeks ahead. Or so I thought!! I was out with ""the boys"" on one of our 6 times a year hook up when we meet for drinks in soho then just turn up at the best restaurant we can walk to and chance our arm at getting a table. On this evening we thought the Ivy would be a fun place to try even though we expected to be turned away with a wry laugh from the reception committee at the door. Well what a pleasant surprise when contrary to our expectation we had just ""hit it right"" and a table was available for the 5 of us and we were of course delighted and amazed. We had a drink at the bar while a table was made available for us. The Ivy is in west street a small street off Cambridge Circus where Shaftesbury Avenue Crosses Charing Cross Road in walking distance from Soho or Covent Garden areas. Nearest tube stops are Tottenham Court Road or Covent Garden but Leicester Square and Piccadilly are also not far away. As I have said usually you need to book at least a month before especially if visiting London for a holiday or short stay. The service at the Ivy is always impeccable and it is exceptionally friendly. The head staff have been here for years and they are particularly good at recognising regular diners. Considering the reputation and difficulty in obtaining a table you will be surprised at the ""ordinary"" menu snd the ""reasonable"" price of the food which is an absolute delight and a surprise if this is your first visit. No difficulty choosing any of the wonderful food served here. Go to www.the-ivy.co.uk/menu. On this occasion I had wonderful bangers and mash with onion gravy - fabulous!

Overall the food was good, although personally I found the crab bisque, that we both had as a starter, was not as full-bodied/flavoured as I expected and perhaps too large a serving. The crab macaroni and crusted cod mains were both very good and I must say the cru velunga chocolate dessert, with blood oranges that I finished with, was excellent. As to the wine, we stuck to an 'entry level' Verdejo which was absolutely fine.

Down a small lane between several theatres' stage doors, it isn't the prettiest approach - but I do urge you to get past it and push on. It's worth it.We had a reservation for noon (only one I could get). We arrived at five-past and it was already filling up.The building is larger inside than you'd think. It is separated into several connected rooms ranging from wood panelled through to the Atlantic Bar (same restaurant really). We were seated in an art deco looking room of half a dozen tables. Nice place setting, good service.We ordered starters and mains with one side (plenty for a lunch). I'd say all the food looks simple - but it's so good! Prawns and potted shrimp to start - I could eat it all again now. Fish pie and salmon mains. The salmon was just salmon. No accompaniment other than the butter sauce. I can't tell you how good it was. We had a desert to share - also very good.It was just a great buzzy atmosphere. One word - this restaurant is busy all the time and does a lot of pre-theatre business. They are used to being efficient and you can get through a three course meal briskly if you like. If time isn't an issue, it is worth just letting your waiter know. Take your time - ask for a few minutes more.One other thing - don't expect to photograph each course and get selfies throughout.

Soon as I walked through the door all fears were blown away. Service was class throughout including the cloakroom. Fantastic mix of punters from established regulars to eager youngsters and people on business smashing the lobster fruit de mer. Was buzzing all evening. Menu isn't that big but it was so hard to chose. I kicked off with the sauted octopus with chorizo and broad beans. Pretty simple but very effective. Followed this up with the mixed roasted shell fish. Standard fair with half a lobster; 3 juicy prawns and one of the scallops with chorizo off the starters menu. The real star though was the razor clams. Not sure what herbs they were cooked in but they were mouth watering. In my opinion every good fish restaurant needs a quality dessert selection. I couldn't help but noticing the adjacent table ordering off menu and having frozen mixed berries with hot white chocolate. Have had this before at Scotts a fair few times. If I have one slight reservation about the whole meal it was that the chocolate sauce could have been a little warmer. Minor gripe though, all the food was delicious.

d719379,g186338,London,J. Sheekey,Restaurant,Sitting at one of the outside tables of the Oyster Bar in the sunshine watching the world go by whilst eating good food and drinking lovely wine certainly ticks a lot of boxes for me. The location of this restaurant is perfect for any theatregoers for either pre or post theatre experiences and once again we loved the quality of the food and the professional service. Would recommend trying the smoked haddock frittata if you want a light meal with a glass of wine - very tasty and also had probably the best squid tempura in a long time. Excellent seafood. This will become a regular when in Theatreland. Also popular with the stars so if you fancy rubbing shoulders it is highly possibly you will spot some as they enjoy a drink after their show.,Date of visit: June 2014,5,4,5,4,People watching with good food!,UID_D465B92CC345F10A23B0C3F0F2F2B6A5,Derbyshire,SerenidadDerbyshire
d719379,g186338,London,J. Sheekey,Restaurant,Met a friend for lunch at The Oyster Bar at Sheekey's and just loved the whole experience. Located right in the heart of Theatreland and a short stroll from Trafalgar Square this really is what a traditional quality London restaurant is about. It is oozing character. The staff are so professional and friendly and you are made welcome immediately even though we only had a couple of small sharing plates and a glass of wine so hardly a huge bill. There were many seated at the bar enjoying what looked like fabulous oysters and that may have to be a return visit delight. The special of the day looked excellent and you just know that the fish being served is only the freshest available. As it was a lovely day there were a few people who chose to eat outdoors in the small lane which must be pretty good for people watching. I took a sneak peak into the main restaurant which comprises of three rooms each done very tastefully with black and white photos of all the good and great of theatre etc who have dined there and you can see why it is quite a favourite of the stars of the stage. Will certainly go back for lunch and hopefully for dinner too.,Date of visit: September 2013,5,5,5,4,Fabulous!,UID_D465B92CC345F10A23B0C3F0F2F2B6A5,Derbyshire,SerenidadDerbyshire

Ordered a bottle of Rioja Rosada which was very pleasant. To start we order 6 Cornish Rock oysters, which were delicious. Followed by a crab roll, tempura squid and some pommes allumettes. Squid arrived, fries arrived but no crab roll. This was because it was freshly made and the guy doing the prep was not supported and it was very busy and he was under pressure to shuck dozens of oysters and prepare salads etc., etc., 30 minutes later still waiting for the crab roll. Eventually it came, and they took it off the final bill and gave us some unwanted chocolate truffles as an apology.

d719379,g186338,London,J. Sheekey,Restaurant,"This was probably the third time in the last 12 months that we had eaten at J Sheekey, on each occasion, prior to going to the theatre. Just before arriving at 6pm (the time of our reservation), slightly oddly, I received a call from the restaurant, asking if we still intended to dine there that evening. Then on arrival I was told that they had in fact called two days earlier to seek my confirmation but were unable to reach me. If that was indeed the case, then why not leave a message for me, as all other restaurants certainly do? The outcome of that particular aspect of our visit, was that we had a far from perfect table, in the area by the bar, that I would suggest is normally given to 'walk-in' guests. The area was busy (transit through to the bars), noisy and frankly not al all comfortable to enjoy dinner. On any other occasion I would have immediately requested another table but this time, somewhat foolishly I did not, which was a mistake. However, in my view the restaurant was to blame for not following up on the confirmation call some days earlier and, I suspect, giving our table in the main restaurant away, which, given we arrived ahead of our reservation time, is unacceptable. On leaving I made the maitr'd aware of the issue and let us see what happens on our next visit. Wiith respect to availability (particularly on a Saturday night), book ahead and make sure you confirm your booking, as J Sheekey does enjoy a more than 'full house' throughout the evening. Moving on to the food (neither of us had starters) the whole lemon sole, on the bone and the hake dish, were both excellent. Very well prepared, in all respects. As I said previously, this was the third visit in the last 12 months and the fish dishes we have enjoyed on each occasion, have always been excellent. The bottom line is, they know how to prepare fish! The choice of wine is very good and quite frankly, the 'entry level' wines are really absolutely fine when you just want a suitable accompaniment for a relatively quick, pre-theatre dinner. Desserts are fine and in fact the William pear tart, with gingerbread ice-cream, is really rather good. Service is attentive, although, again it might be related to where we sat, as the restaurant got busier at around 7pm, we did need to 'chase' our desserts, in order to leave in time to make the theatre.
